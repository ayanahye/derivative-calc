#### Description:

My project is a derivative calculator. It was assembled using Flask, Python, HTML, and CSS. It is flexible/responsive and the content on each page fits to satisfy the needs of various screen sizes and devices. Furthermore, the module used for differentiation is Sympy. Sympy is a Math library for Python.

The first page of my website is the Home page. This is where the computation occurs. The user will be prompted to input their equation and they could either press the submit button or hit enter. In doing so the answer will appear below. 

However, the format for inputting equations could be a bit confusing so I added an Instructions tab. This tab outlines the structure and contains examples for the user to refer to. Furthermore, it is responsive and the text wraps around to accommodate the width of the screen.

The last page of my website is the About Me page. This page was created using flexbox and it is nested in a grid. While working on this page I acquired a lot of practice with displaying pictures using CSS and Flask. It was also the toughest portion of the project since the pictures were not succumbing and were going all over the place. 

To conclude, this project helped me get used to Flask syntax and my CSS skills have improved. I also obtained practice using “GET” and “POST” methods in Python and app routes. Though it's simple, I am proud of my project and how far I have come since I started the course. I am incredibly appreciative of this course and I will keep learning and designing.
